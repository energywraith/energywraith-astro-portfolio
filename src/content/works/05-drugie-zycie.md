## Campaign Focus

**Organ transplation** is an **important topic**, it's something we can all agree upon.
Nonetheless, finding the right candidate for organ donation remains challenging.
Campaigns like **Drugie Życie** aim raise awareness among people on this subject.
My role in the mentioned campaign was **designing promotional materials**.

## Target Audience

Our target audience encompassed **individuals of all ages**. To reach a diverse audience,
the campaign distributed flyers in schools and at related events.
Therefore, it was crucial to ensure the designs were **easily accessible to everyone**.
I opted for **simple designs** that could be quickly understood, allowing people to grasp the topic at a glance.
